Sizable Stop Mixing in Flavored Gauge Mediation Models with Discrete Non-Abelian Symmetries


Results:
First figure: different mMess with fixed tanBeta(10). Lambda fixed by higgs
Heavy Higgs at 5-6 gEv, gluino at 5, with squarks in two




Questions for Lisa:
why does Todd keep sign of mu as a model paramter. Flagged into code, taking a particular value. May be positive
what is the b parameter? coupling constant to hUp hDown. We substitute this wiht tanBeta (tan(vev(hUp)/veb(hDown))). use mZ and tan(beta ) instead of b and mu
"Due to increased renormalization group running effects, the μ and b/μ terms are lighter than in the previous case, which leads to lighter masses for the heavy Higgs states."


 Counting degrees. If I remember right, the number of degrees of freedom double (find out why), and going from 4 (3 quark bosons and on higgs) to 8 (now with the 4 heavy higgs). this indirectly lets you ignore the b values from the scalar higgs field. Having an up higgs and down higgs doulbe the degrees of freedom above


 Quantum numbers and symmetry?


 My analysis:
 Low mMess: Increasing TanBeta 
 				lowers massive higgs
 				lowers higher gauginos
 				creates a lower differention of high squark families
 				differentiats lowers sleptons
 raising mMess: 
 			Lowers the following: massive higgs, all gauginos (inparticular the "gaugino"), squarks (except e1), raises sleptons
 			changes the sqaurk families: the second lowest family moves the the middle
 			raises e1
high mMess: Increasing TanBeta
				bleeds the lower families of top squarks into the middle smoothly
				lowers massive higgs, e1, differentiates lower sleptons and high sleptons (less so), lowers higg gaurinos

lower case b: in higgs potential
