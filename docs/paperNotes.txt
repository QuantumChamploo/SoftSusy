stop mixing (s top quark mixing i believe)

the Higgs mass is known to be within the theoretically allowed range for perturbative theories, but its relatively high value either requires large radiative corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), or an enlarged Higgs sector to boost the tree-level contributions.

^^ so susy predicts it to be lower?

up and down higgs?
